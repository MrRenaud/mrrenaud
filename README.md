### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Renaud Dumont**, a developer from Belgium, Mons.

![](https://www.sparkle.tech/images/app/logo.png)

I run a small company called  [Sparkle](https://www.sparkle.tech) which aims at creating digital products and services with our clients. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects for entrepreneurs in Belgium and in France.

âœ¨ I prefer to code with TypeScript and C#. I mainly build stuff with ReactJS, React Native and ASP.NET Core.

ðŸ“£ I organize the [DevDay](https://devday.be) in Belgium with a team of local developers. It's my way to give back to the community.

ðŸŽ¼ Eventually, I spent time making music [here](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0MZQZskQHnEbgCgzJfZu65) and [there](https://soundcloud.com/morzak).
