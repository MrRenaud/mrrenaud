### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Renaud Dumont, a developer from Belgium, Mons.

![](https://www.sparkle.tech/images/app/logo.png)

I run a small company called  [Sparkle](https://www.sparkle.tech) which aims at creating digital products and services with our clients. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects for entrepreneurs in Belgium and in France.

âœ¨ I prefer to code with JavaScript / TypeScript and C#. I mainly build stuff with ReactJS, React Native and ASP.NET Core.

ðŸ“£ I organize the [DevDay](https://devday.be) in Belgium with a team of local developers. It's my way to give back to the community.

ðŸ“– In a previous life, I wrote a technical book to teach people how to build (Metro) apps for Windows 8 in HTML5 and JavaScript ([here](http://www.ma-editions.com/informatique/1-micro-application/41-le-guide-complet-titan/4192/developpez-en-html-5-pour-windows-8/)).

ðŸŽ¼ Eventually, I spent time making music. And I released something on Spotify under the name of [Morzak](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0MZQZskQHnEbgCgzJfZu65?si=vH5_Ts5NRUmwa-9svia70w)
